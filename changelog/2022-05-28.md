- Fixed a bug where `/notes` API returns duplicated notes
- Fixed a bug where `/notes` API crashes on certain filtering conditions
- Fixed a bug where `Gitcoin` are not fetching the latest data
- Fixed a bug where `BSC chain` does not return the correct data when too many addresses (>150) are being included in one query
- Refactored the code to remove legacy codebase

As the result, the overall API performance has been improved drastically. On certain extreme cases where a huge amount of data is being requested in 1 query, the response time was reduced from over 50s down to less than 2s.
