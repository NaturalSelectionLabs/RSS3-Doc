Today we are thrilled to announce that PreGod v1.0.0 is officially in production ðŸ¥³.

v1.0.0 includes major changes to the structure returned by our APIs, head to our [API Playground](/PreGod/api) to see what's new.

Our dev members had put in a lot of efforts to improve the performance and usability. Behind the scene we have also improved the performance of our indexing modules. To address a common challenge faced by Web3 developers, we pre-process the on-chain data in a format that can be easily used to kickstart your dApp developments. Here is a quick overview of what makes PreGod v1.0.0 an ideal choice for Web3 developers:

1. Support [8 networks](/docs/product/PreGod/introduction#list-of-networks) with various popular platforms such as Lens (and every dApp deployed on Lens Protocol).
1. Support [6 curated tags](/docs/product/PreGod/introduction#list-of-tags-and-corresponding-types) and child types for granularity.

We are happy to work with you, in fact a great thank you to those who provided feedback during the testing phase ðŸŽ‰.

Currently, we are preparing the following improvements for our future versions:

1. Support more `network` (Solana, Arbitrum, Optimistic, and Avalanche are pinned on the board).
1. Support more `platform`, such as OATs on galaxy.eco.
1. Support more `tag` and `type` for a higher level of granularity.
1. Optimize the structure of `note` based on the feedback from developers (we already have a long listðŸ¤£).

While v1.0.0 will remind free to use, there will be rate limiting (600 req/min) implemented, we plan to gradually increase the limit over time as we see fit.
