We used to publish a weekly summary of our dev progress, and recently we have been really busy with all the ongoing projects. We've decided to change this approach to a more flexible one.

The Dev Log is purely a dev-centric place to share our progress, we see it as a means for promoting community transparency. Here you will see our product changelogs, important technical decisions, and occasionally product teasers.

We hope that all interested developers can join our community, below in the footer you will see the links to our Discord and Github.
