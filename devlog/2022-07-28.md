## What's new

PreGod v1.0.0 was released 20 days ago, today we have shipped v1.1.0.

### Unified Metadata Schemas(UMS)

The new version introduced a new concept of [UMS](/docs/product/PreGod/unified_metadata_schemas).

UMS aims to consolidate on-chain data from multiple data sources into a uniform format, so you don't have to. Developers no longer need to build complex business logic to handle heterogeneous structures (you are welcome ðŸ¥³), e.g., a post on Mirror looks very different than one on Crossbell, and UMS takes care of that.

UMS will be constantly enhanced to support more `Type`s.

### Spam Handling

We observed a lot of POAP spammers, so in v1.1.0 POAPs are not returned by default unless the request comes with `include_poap=true` or `tag=collectible&type=poap`. We plan to enhance this functionality to include other `Type`s in the future.

### Platform Endpoint

`/platforms` is the a new endpoint, as requested by developers. It returns all possible values for `platform` supported by v1.1.0.

### Performance Enhancements

Based on the feedback of developers, we have made some major improvements:

- Improved the accuracy of assigning `Tag` and `Type` to transactions.
- Improved the data granularity of `Donation`, `Governance` to include more relevant information.
- Redesigned `Exchange` - `Swap`, and minor changes for others.

## Migration

- Adaption of UMS, a one-time adaption and you can support all future data sources
- Removed per address filtering in `/notes` POST, the filters are now global
- Lens integration (posts and comments) is temporarily removed as we are not satisfied with the  outcome. It will be back in the next version. Profiles and Follower NFTs are still included in v1.1.0.

Since v1.1.0 has slightly altered the structure to accommodate UMS, some lightweight migration work is required for migration, head to our [API Playground](/PreGod/api) to find out what's different. Meanwhile, v1.0.0 will be put into the maintenance-only mode, receiving critical security fixes only. **Developers are encouraged to migrate to v1.1.0 at the earliest convenience.**

### PreGod v0.4.0

PreGod v0.4.0 will also be deprecated soon. **We encourage all developers to migrate to v1.1.0 as soon as possible.**
