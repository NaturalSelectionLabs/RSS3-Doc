> RSS3 is an open information syndication protocol that aims to support efficient and decentralized information distribution in Web3.

## Why RSS3

The right to create, disseminate and distribute information should not be in the hands of centralized governing. It is the basic right of cyber lives.

Gradually over the past two decades, several data superpowers have controlled contents and links to create a toxic centralized atmosphere, where privacy and freedom are sacrificed for profits. This atmosphere further hinders innovations: No matter how well you design and engineer your application, there is no way to compete with the data monopolies.

The world has been eager for a new way of information syndication. RSS used to be the pioneer of its time, now itâ€™s time for us to pick up the baton and carry on.

Derived from the best out of RSS, RSS3 is an open information syndication protocol that aims to support efficient and decentralized information distribution in Web3. It defines the format of information presence and communication, with this elegantly designed, user-friendly content format, clients can easily access a variety of content sources in a uniform format without the need for extensive compatibility logic.
