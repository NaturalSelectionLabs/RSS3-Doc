# Introduction

RSS3 PreGod marks a milestone towards our ultimate goal, a fully decentralized service that provides the Web3 feed of any instance.

As an implementation of the RSS3 Protocol, PreGod provides a set of simple-to-use APIs to access the feed of Web3. Currently, the stable version is [![RSS3](https://badge.rss3.workers.dev/?version=v0.4.0)](https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/RSS3/blob/main/versions/v0.4.0.md). The source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/RSS3-PreGod).

The release of PreGod v0.4.0 also means that PreNode v0.3.1 will be switched to a maintenance-only state, aiming to support the existing applications that rely on it.

## API endpoint

Current stable endpoint: <https://pregod.rss3.dev/v0.4.0>
